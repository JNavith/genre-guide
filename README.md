# genre.guide
The code that powers genre.guide (not up yet and probably won't be for a long time)


How to use:
1. Configure (todo: add more information on this)
2. Run the `./install` script to fetch all the necessary data and build images
3. Run the `./run` script to run the containers that need to be up
