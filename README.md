How to use:
These instructions are out of date.

1. Create a project in the Google API console and make a service account that has access to the Drive API. Download its `client_secret.json` file and place it in the `config` directory (replacing the one currently there). A decent overview of how to do that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vISRn5qFrkM)
1. Update `google-sheets.env` to reflect the characteristics of your own spreadsheet


## Contributing

Open an issue (whether or not you know how to program the fix/feature, or have any idea why there's a problem, or are confused about something) or pull request. It can be about anything. I am intending to be welcoming to all kinds of contribution.
